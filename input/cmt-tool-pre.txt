-Thanks for always putting maximum effort into this game [Keyword], keep it up. ^_^
-That first playthrough is one of the best experiences I've had in games hands down. And it's AI and world are so dense it makes going back and back and seeing all new interactions hundreds of hours into your playthrough, so interesting
-This is still a good video but it makes us realize the hard work you guys put into finding good content. Thank you! :-)
-Does anyone remember [Keyword] from like 2012? I used to love exploring that map because there was just so much content like a main hotel, a market, a huge waterslide, redstone museum, etc.
It think back then it was one of the most popular maps on [Keyword] :D
-There are also some[Keyword]servers that are empty a lot of the time. While most of them aren't completely dead, walking around on an empty [Keyword] (or one with very few players) can certainly feel liminal as well. Especially if it is a very old map, where players built a lot of cities and buildings/structures over the years that you can explore all alone.
You might walk around exploring old towns on [Keyword] for hours without encountering any other player at all, which has a similar feeling as this. ^_^
-Fresh perspective on this speedrun having the devs talking in context of[Keyword] being close to release!
-Ive taken a gaming hiatus to focus more on my personal life and growth. Been waiting specifically for this game and its going to be worth every second of waiting....^_^
-So far looking like the best season ever coming close to chapter 2 season 2.Pro tip: kick your legs to move better. Also, theres a setting for easier movement. But its always fun to watch yall together! Even if you do make it harder on yourselves!
-at this point [channel] is still having his mind thinking of one thing: "ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT"
-20:01 is the best scene in this video 
Bro literally you made me happy 
 
love you jod editer
-Oh my god- you actually did it! Thank you!!!

This was entertaining as hell:-)
-I love your videos, and part of that, is when you are winning you dont bury your opponent or act douchey like some other people I wont name, and when you are losing you arent super negative and bashing your opponent. I appreciate the positivity. I DEF can understand how frustrating this game may be for them, I dont think any game I play for "fun" is as annoying as this game can be at times..   but sometimes its annoying to listen to that in a video
-I have been playing mc for almost 12 years now and im not even kidding when i say this but i have never noticed the screen tilting when getting hit. Lmaobro cares about protein more than his stomach
-Lee skill
-hey whats that little legend?? is it with 8.5?
-Syan Axolotl is the best colllor
-The way I shouted "YES!!" when I saw this uploaded after work. I loved Sean's RE8 playthrough and rewatched the series twice lmaoo

Also shout-out to pixl_pit for editing Sean's videos! They're so clean and never cease to make me laugh8.5
-2022 and this song still has the ability to bring out the life left in me,The early full-release seeds give me a lot of nostalgia because I started playing in the era of huge oceans. I remember it taking me over 10 minutes of sailing to find even one small island.
-It's hard to imagine a cozier room... I also really love the combination of blizzard and fireplace sounds, so this video will definitely play in the background when I go to sleep tonight!  :(
-if this was me everyone would just turn around and shoot.....
-You make me wanna get back on this game lol.
-This game makes the player feel like you drifting in mid air how crazy is the mobility
-WOW the first session was unreal:-)
-And people are asking why he won the streamer award lol.
The best content creator 👏
-i started playing TFT only like a week ago and your videos have really helped me get better :) i went from silver 4 to gold 4 in only a few days😃Havent laughed so hard in awhile when Nasus was recruited by Syndra! 😂
-Ahh, I needed that laugh. Love ya man, great content as always! ❤
-The intro is top tier ! :D
-isn't the hurricanes actually good? cuz the extra damage scaled from ad and yous tack so much ad from the augment. so the extra bolt does an extra 200, and thast per auto
-Jokes on[channel] i did throw a game to get a 3 star janna sold my entried board but janna and my carry and didnt get it.
-Can't keep the dog down!
-How to beat the boring ass laser dog comp I see slammed every single game?
-
That last player's literally the definition of a sore loser.I missed the old morgana where she summons a huge pool that damages an area.
-I wake up early in the morning to watch. Honestly, keeping my consistency of waking up early and watching some pog runs! ❤️you could have had a 3 star nunu this game with the number of nunus you saw^_^
-Internet crashing once a month? Try once an hour in Germanistan
-bro I actually cant wtf why did he surrender he had a good chance of winning thats such a fucking let down.Pog I was here
-30:08 I agree Sivir's better but why is it "literally not even close" for you? The 49 base AD? I would've thought Ace + hitting 2 targets at higher % AD ratio would be at least worth *considering*, even if it's not strictly always better? (490% and 2nd target at ~392% vs 1 target at 410, and 10 mana cheaper)
-an you do ace, mecha, renegade fiddle 2 with talon,syslas,camille,viego,leona,draven,mf,samira 1? its hard but not impossible xd.wait scrapie was the lucky pogger xd
-Can someone explain to me why he would only be above 70 gold once when he has rich get richer. Is he not playing nearly the whole game down an gold augment. He was only above 70 gold once, gold augment for 2-3 gold. I need it explained cause im new to the game and dont understand a lot.holy cow
-dang😂
-So early dayum.pog^_^
-His Rich get Richer augment was never used lol. wait sorry only two rounds with 60 gold then he completely forgot he even have the augment lol
-What was the point of rich get richer? Besides the starting gold did it do anything?
-Jewled lotus=3 recon

You gain alredy crit from agumen 
+recon crit
=3 recon 100%crit so more front line (broken)OP but personally it's kinda disappointing, I was hoping for ashe's level speed on normal summoner's rift
-Oh i thought you actually get the zekes on top of it, cause that would be "FULL" 👏
-I need your music playlist right now  👏
-15:22 Nilah and Kai Sa and skipped haha :D sad time..❤
-Man those videos would be okay if u put somewhat good music or mute, to watch this u literally gave to mute the video
-A true narcissist, blames everyone else but himself 👏
-he has goals for this country that we must not let him achieve, this country will never be a dictatorship unless we vote for it, and that must not happen.:)
-I learned how to look up laws. So 18 U.S.C. § 373 states “It is a felony under federal law to intentionally solicit, command, induce, or otherwise endeavor to persuade” another person to engage in a crime of violence against a person or property.” It's a FELONY!  I'm utterly distraught at how the laws are being applied to this mafia boss.

This case compellingly shows how low they can descend and express their extreme vengence . 😅⚖️🗽😅😅
-All the cowardly republicans should have to foot the bill for this preparation in New York and Trump should be sued for all expenses.I pray for airtight indictments against trump and his minions.
